# Quantum-computing

This is the repository where my work in Quantum Computing is maintained.

It currently has my work in the Microsoft Q# competition held in Codeforces for both the practice round(june 29 - july1) and the actual contest(july 6- 9)  
Also it has other pdfs related to quantum computing.
